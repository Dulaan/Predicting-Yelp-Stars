yelp_final codebook

business_id, type str, is a unique identifier for individual restaurants

all features that begin with "categories_", type num, are dummy coded variables representing individual categories, with 1 representing that the obs has that tag
and 0 representing that the obs doesn't have that tag

stars, type num, is the star rating of the restaurant.

state, type chr, is the state the restaurant is in.

review_count is the number of reviews the restaurant has. 

The original dataset was multiple gigabytes worth of data so I will not be including it. I will however be including my final dataset.
